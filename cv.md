About me
--------

I have been working in the IT sector for many years as an engineer and
head of a service center.

A few years ago he became interested in programming and began to study
Java. I realized that I want to do this professionally.

When working with web projects based on Spring, knowledge of HTML, CSS,
Javascript was required. For further training, it was decided to take
training at RS School. In the courses I also hope to find like-minded
people, and possibly new friends.
